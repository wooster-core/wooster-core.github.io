# wooster-core.github.io
The website for the College of Wooster's Collaborative Research Environment

This is one landing page for CoRE. We have used it as a learning opportunity for CoRE Consultants, as they can manage the CSS and HTML of the site and they can practice with git, github, and repositories. Students can also (by way of github) practice Markdown. 
The site is built from an [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) template, in this case ["Landed"](https://html5up.net/landed). 
Managed by [the "wooster-core" group](https://github.com/wooster-core) on github.
